# Medical-Info_Sys
This project is called "Medical Info System" and has been developed under the mentorship of Ms. Anjani Gupta, an Assistant Professor at PIET in the CSE Department. The project was executed by the students of CSE 3rd Year (20-24): Md Saheb (2820032), Rahul Kr Kapar (2820168), Ayush Kr Jha (2820073).

The Medical Info System is a web application that focuses on providing blockchain-based access control for seamless access to medical information by both patients and doctors. Although the implementation of access control using blockchain is planned for future directives, it is currently pending due to resource limitations and time constraints.

Additional aspects of our project are documented in various sections within the same repository. We appreciate your interest and support.

Thank you.
